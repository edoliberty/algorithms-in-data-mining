\lecture{4}{Count Sketches}{Edo Liberty}

Here we will define a data structure called a CountSketch. 
It will allow us to estimate the number of times the most frequent elements in a stream appeared.

We we denote the elements by $o_1,\ldots,o_m$ having each appeared $n_1 \ge \ldots \ge n_m$
(the names of the elements are ordered according to their frequency).
Before describing the CountSketch structure, let us first analyze one of its building blocks.
For lack of a more creative name, we will call it $B$.
$B$ is an array of length $b$ which is associated with two hash functions:
$h: o \rightarrow [1,\ldots,b]$ and $s: o \rightarrow [-1,1]$.
  
We define two function for $B$ one for adding elements into it.
\begin{enumerate}
\item define $Add(o)$:
\item \tab $B[h(o)] = B[h(o)] + s(o)$. 
\end{enumerate} 
and one for returning an estimate for $n_i$ given $o_i$
\begin{enumerate}
\item define $Query(o)$:
\item \tab return $B[h(o)]s(o)$. 
\end{enumerate} 

In order to compute the expectation of $B[h(o)]s(o)$ we need to define the ``inverse" of $h$. 
Let $h^{-1}(o_i) = \{o_j | h(o_j) = h(o_i)\}$. In words, $h^{-1}(o_i)$ is the set of all elements for $h(o_i)=h(o_j)$.
Since each element in $o_j \in h^{-1}(o_i)$ is encountered exactly $n_j$ times and for each of those $s(o_j)$ is added to $B[h(o)]$
we have that $B[h(o_i)] = \sum_{o_j \in h^{-1}(o_i)} n_j s(o_j)$.
$$
E[B[h(o_i)]s(o_i)] = \sum_{o_j \in h^{-1}(o_i)} n_j s(o_j)s(o_i) = n_i + \sum_{o_j \in h^{-1}(o_i),o_i \ne o_j} n_j s(o_j)s(o_i) = n_i
$$

First, we see that if $b > 8k$ we have that $|h^{-1}(o_i)\cap\{o_1,\ldots,o_k\} |=0$ with probability at least $7/8$.
In other words, the element $o_i$ does not map under $h$ to the same cell in $B$ with any of the top $k$ frequency items.
We will define $h^{-1}_{>k} = h^{-1}(o_i)\cap\{o_{k+1},\ldots,o_m\}$.
We will assume from this point on that $h^{-1}(o_i) \subset \{o_{k+1},\ldots,o_m\}$ or in other words that $h^{-1}_{>k} = h^{-1}(o_i)$.

Now, let us bound the variance of $B[h(o_i)]s(o_i)$.
\begin{eqnarray*}
Var(B[h(o_i)]s(o_i)) &\le & E[B[h(o_i)]^2 s(o_i)^2] \\
&=& E[(\sum_{o_j \in h^{-1}_{>k}(o_i)} n_j s(o_j))(\sum_{o_{j'} \in h^{-1}_{>k}(o_i)} n_{j'} s(o_{j'}))]\\
&= & E_h \sum_{o_j \in h^{-1}_{>k}(o_i)} \sum_{o_{j'} \in h^{-1}_{>k}(o_i)} E_s [n_j n_{j'} s(o_j) s(o_{j'}) ]\\
&= &E_h  \sum_{o_j \in h^{-1}_{>k}(o_i)}n^2_j \\
&= &\sum_{j = k+1}^{m}n^2_j / b
\end{eqnarray*}
Note that we have both an expectation over the choice of the hash function $s$ and over the hash function $h$.

Using this bound on the variance of $B[h(o_i)]s(o_i)$ and Chebyshev's inequality we attain that:
$$
\Pr\left[ \left| B[h(o_i)]s(o_i) - n_i \right| > \sqrt{8 \sum_{j = k+1}^{m}n^2_j / b} \right] \le 1/8
$$

However, note that we also demanded that none of the top $k$ elements map to the same cell as $o_i$
which only happened with probability $7/8$. Using the union bound on these two events we get:   
$$
\Pr\left[ \left| \hat{n}_i - n_i \right| \le \gamma \right] \ge 3/4
$$
where we denote $\hat{n}_i =  B[h(o_i)]s(o_i)$ and $\gamma = \sqrt{8 \sum_{j = k+1}^{m}n^2_j / b}$.

Note that this happens for every elements individually only with constant probability.
We would like to get that this holds with probability $1-\delta$ for all elements simultaneously.
We do that by repeating this entire structure $t$ times creating the CountSketch $B_1,\ldots,B_t$.
When inserting an element we insert it into all $t$ arrays $B_i$ and above. 
When querying the CountSketch we return $query(o_i) = Median(\hat{n}^1_i,\ldots,\hat{n}^t_i)$ where $\hat{n}^\ell_i$
is the estimator $\hat{n}_i$ from $B_\ell$. 

Because $\Pr\left[ \left| \hat{n}_i - n_i \right| \le \gamma \right] \ge 3/4$ we get from Chernoff's inequality that
at least half the values $\hat{n}^\ell_i$ will be such that $\left| \hat{n}^\ell_i - n_i \right| \le \gamma$ (including the median)
for all $m$ elements with probability at least $1-\delta$ for $t \in O(log(m/\delta))$.

The only thing left to do is set the correct value for $b$ (the length of $B$).
We will demand that $\gamma \le \epsilon n_k$. This gives $b \ge 8\sum_{i=k+1}^{m}n^2_i/\eps^2 n_k^2$.
Therefore, for $t = O(log(m/\delta))$ and $b \ge 8\max(k,\frac{\sum_{i=k+1}^{m}n^2_i}{\eps^2 n_k^2})$
with probability at least $1-\delta$ for each element in the stream $|\hat{n}_i - n_i| \le \eps n_k$.



The algorithm for finding the most frequent items is therefore to go over the stream and keep a CountSketch 
of all the elements seen this far. When we process an element, we also estimate it's frequency $\hat{n}$ an keep the top $k$
most frequent items in estimated frequencies. These are guaranteed to to contain all elements $o_i$ for which $n_i > (1+2\eps)n_k$
and not to contain any element  $o_i$ for which $n_i < (1-2\eps)n_k$.
