## Data Mining 

is concerned with efficiently extracting statistics,
patterns, structures, or meanings from raw data. This task becomes
hard when the amount of data is large, which is often the case in
modern data sets. This course will survey modern algorithms, concepts,
and data structures common to data mining in large data sets. We will
try to cover, among other topics: data sampling, finding causal
relations and frequent item sets, counting in data streams, ranking
and sorting, approximating large matrix operations, dimensionality
reduction and efficient searching in high dimensions. We will also
discuss modern cluster architectures and computational models.
I recommend that students be familiar with probability theory,
basic combinatorics, linear algebra, basic complexity theory, and
traditional data structures, at least on at introductory level. The
class will attempt to be self contained nonetheless.


## Class Details

The class takes place 9:00 to 12:00 in room 112 of the Dan David building. (We are no longer in Dan David 204)

### Undergraduate students:

* Final exam (50% of the grade).
* Home assignments (50% of the grade).
* A project (for extra credit) is optional for students who are interested.

### Master and PhD students:
* No final exam.
* Home assignments (50% of the grade).
* Final project (50% of the grade). Should require roughly a week's worth of work, comparable to learning for and taking the final exam. These project can contain both theoretical and experimental elements.
