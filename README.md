# Algorithms in Data Mining
Contains Edo Liberty's class notes from the advanced course Algorithms in Data Mining given in Tel Aviv University during academic years 2011-2012-2013. These notes are intended to be used freely by academics anywhere, students and professors alike.

The class notes contain simple algorithms needed in the analysis of large amounts of data. The algorithms are presented in their most basic form for didactic reasons. The proofs for the provided algorithms correctness is also designed to be as simple as possible, self contained, and presentable in roughly one long frontal session. An advanced undergraduate or graduate student with some hands-on experience in probability, linear algebra, algorithms, and combinatorics should be able to follow this course.

Contributions and corrections are highly encouraged in the form of pull requests.
