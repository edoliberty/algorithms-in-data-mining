\section{Approximating the size of a tree}
\subsection*{setup}
In this question we will try to approximate the number of leaves in
a tree. A binary tree is a graph consisting of internal nodes
and $n$ leaves. Each internal node, $u$, has two children. A left
child $l(u)$ and a right child $r(u)$. The only node which does not have
a parent is the root of the tree $u_{root}$. For each node we also
denote by $d(u)$ its depth in the tree which is the distance from
the root. For example $d(u_{rood}) = 0$ and $d(r(u_{root}))=1$.

We define a random walk on a tree as the process of starting at the
root and then randomly moving to one of the children until we hit a
leaf. More precisely:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $u \leftarrow u_{root}$
\item while $u$ is an internal node
\item $\tab$ w.p. $1/2$
\item \tab \tab $u \leftarrow l(u)$
\item \tab otherwise
\item \tab \tab $u \leftarrow r(u)$
\item return $u$
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{questions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Let the leaf $u$ be at depth $d(u)$. Calculate the
probability, $p(u)$, that the random walk outputs $u$?
\item Let $x$ be the output leaf of a random walk and let $f(x) =
2^{d(x)}$ be a function defined on the leaves. Compute the value of:
\[
E_{x\sim w}[f(x)]
\]
where $x\sim w$ denotes that $x$ is chosen according to the
distribution on the leaves generated by the random walk.
\item We say that a tree is $c$-balanced if $d(u) \le \log_2{n} + c$ for all leaves in the tree.
Show that for a $c$-balanced tree
\[
\Var_{x\sim w}[f(x)] \le 2^{c}n^2
\]
\item Let $Y = \frac{1}{s}\sum_{i=1}^{s}f(x_i)$ where $x_i$ are
output nodes of $s$ independent random walks on the tree. Compute
$E[Y]$ {\bf and} show that $\var[Y] \le 2^{c}n^2/s$.
\item Use Chebyshev's inequality to find a value for $s$ such that for two constants
$\eps \in [0,1]$ and $\delta \in [0,1]$:
\[
\Pr[|Y - n| > \eps n ] < \delta.
\]
$s$ should be a function of $c$, $\eps$ and $\delta$.

\section{Approximate histograms}
\subsection*{setup}
We are given a stream of elements $x_1,\ldots, x_N$ where $x_i \in \{a_1,\ldots,a_n\}$.
Let $n_i$ denote the number of times element $a_i$ appeared in the stream, i.e., $n_i = |\{ j | x_j = a_i \}|$.
Our goal is to estimate $n_i$ for all frequent elements.
Let the sub stream $y$ include every element in the stream $x$ with probability $p$.
let $\hat{n}_i = |\{ j | y_j = a_i \}|$ be the number of times $a_i$ appears in $y$.  
\subsection*{questions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Let $z_i = \hat{n}_{i}/p$, compute $\E[z_i]$
\item Assume $a_1$ is such that $n_1 \ge \theta N$ for some fixed $\theta$.
Compute a value for $p$ (as low as possible) which guaranties that $n_1 (1+\eps)\ge z_1 \ge n_1 (1-\eps)$ w.p. at least $1/2$. 
\item Assume $a_1$ is such that $n_1 < \theta N(1-2\eps)$ for some fixed $\theta$.
Compute a value for $p$ (as low as possible) which gives that $z_1 \le \theta N(1-\eps)$ w.p. at least $1/2$. 
\item Use the union bound to specify a value for $p$ which guaranties that for every $i$, if $n_i \ge \theta N$
then $n_i (1+\eps)\ge z_i \ge n_i (1-\eps)$ and if $n_i < \theta N (1-2\eps)$ then $z_i \le \theta N (1-\eps)$ with probability at least $1-\delta$. 
\item Compare this result with the algorithm described in class for approximately counting frequent items in streams, which is better under what circumstances?
