\section{Randomized meta-algorithms}
\subsection*{setup}
In this question we assume the common case where we have an input $x \in X$  
and we wish to approximate a function $f:X \rightarrow \R^+$ (i.e. $\forall x\;\;f(x) \ge 0$).
For that we have a black box randomized algorithm $A:X\rightarrow \R^+$ such that $\E[A(x)] = f(x)$.
The questions ask you to designing meta algorithms using $A$ as a black box. 
\subsection*{question}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Show that
\[
\Pr[A(x) \ge 3f(x)] \le \frac{1}{3}
\]
\item Assume that for all $x$ we have that $\Var[A(x)] \le c\cdot [f(x)]^2$.
Describe an algorithm $B_2$ such that for any two constants $\eps,\delta > 0$:
\[
\Pr[|B_2(x) - f(x)| \ge \eps f(x)] \le \delta
\]
\item Assume that $\Pr[|A(x) - f(x) | \le t|] \ge \frac{1}{2}+\eta$ for some fixed value $\eta > 0$.
In words, the algorithm gets an additive approximation $t$ with probability slightly better than $1/2$.
(Here we do not assume anything on the variance of $A(x)$).
Design and algorithm $B_3$ such that for any prescribed $\delta >0$
\[
\Pr[|B_3(x) - f(x) | \le t|] \ge 1 - \delta
\]
That means the algorithm achieves the same additive approximation with probability arbitrary close to one.

\section{SVD and the power method}
\subsection*{setup}

Here we will prove some basic facts about singular values, matrices, and the power method.
For the reminder of the question we assume $A \in \R^{m \times n}$ is an arbitrary matrix.
For convenience and w.l.o.g. assume $m \le n$. Also, denote by $\sigma_1 \ge \ldots \sigma_m \ge 0$
the singular values of $A$.
\subsection*{question}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Let $P \in \R^{m \times m}$ and $Q \in \R^{n \times n}$ be unitary matrices.
Show that $\|PAQ\|_{fro} = \|A\|_{fro}$.
Hint, begin with the case where one of the matrices $P$ or $Q$ are the identity matrix.
\item Using the above show that for any matrix $A$ we have that 
\[
\|A\|_{fro} = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{m}\sigma_{i}^{2}}.
\]
It might help you to show that $\|A\|^{2}_{fro} = tr(AA^T)$ where $tr(\cdot)$ stands for the matrix trace.
\item The numerical rank of a matrix $\rho(A) = \frac{\|A\|^{2}_{fro}}{\|A\|^2_2}$ is a smoothed
version of the algebraic rank $rank(A)$. It is always true that $1\le \rho(A) \le Rank(A) \le \min(m,n)$.
If $\rho(A) \le 1 +\eps$ for a sufficiently small $\eps$ the matrix is ``close'' to being of rank $1$.
Give an expression to the numerical rank of $A$ in terms of its
singular values $\sigma_i$. Express the numerical rank of $(AA^T)^{k}A$ in term of  $\sigma_i$.
\item Assume that the matrix $A$ is such that $\sigma_2/\sigma_1 \le \eta$ for some $\eta < 1$.
Use your expressions from above to find $k$ such that $\rho((AA^T)^{k}A)) \le  1+ \eps$.
How does this relate to the the Power Method for computing the largest singular value and vectors of $A$?
\end{enumerate}
